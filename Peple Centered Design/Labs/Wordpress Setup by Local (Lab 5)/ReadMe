Wordpress is a free open source (FOSS) content management system (CMS) for the web,
used historically to create blogs, but has since found wider use, including static and e-commerce sites.

For this lab I use an application called “Local” by Flywheel to install 
a local wordpress development site, which can be used for single-user prototyping
and testing on your local machine without a server. In this lab I created 3 pages and block just
as an inroduction to the wordpress.
